    After selling Measure Media (a UX/Analytics agency) in 2021, I have been doing Fractional CMO & UX/UA consulting. 
    I help my clients implement data driven acquisition & retention programs to optimize CAC / LTV metrics and fuel growth. 

    In addition, I co-founded a portfolio of cycling apparel brands with a mission to make cycling apparel accessible. I'm an avid cyclist and outdoor recreation enthusiast.
    Our products help people get into cycling, which has had a profound impact on my personal health and wellness.  This is my passion project. 

    We operate three websites: 
    [UrbanCycling.com](https://urbancycling.com)
    [KonaTriApparel.com](https://konatriapparel.com), and 
    [Ozarkcycling.com](https://ozarkcycling.com), along with a 3PL warehouse near Bentonville, Arkansas.

#
#    Including an interest section in your resume can be helpful if your interests are relevant to the job you are applying for, such as if you are applying for a job in a creative field and your hobbies include painting or writing. It can also be useful if you are applying for a job where teamwork or social skills are important, and you can mention interests that demonstrate those qualities.

#    When listing references, be sure to include the individual's name, job title, company name, phone number, and email address. It's also a good idea to ask for the individual's permission before listing them as a reference, and to let them know what kind of job you are applying for so they can speak to your relevant skills and experience.
#
#    It's important to choose references who can provide a positive and comprehensive evaluation of your work. Avoid listing family members or friends as references, and instead focus on individuals who can speak to your professional abilities and accomplishments.
